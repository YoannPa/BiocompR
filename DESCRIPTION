Description: BiocompR is a R package built upon ggplot2, and using data.table.
             It improves some visualisations commonly used in biology and
             genomics for data comparison and dataset exploration, introduces
             new kind of plots, provides a toolbox of functions to work with
             ggplot2 and grid objects, and ultimately, allows users to customize
             plots produced into publication ready figures.
